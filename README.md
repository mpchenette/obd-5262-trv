   - also generating mermaid diagrams
1. Agent Mode - when to use it
1. Code Review(s)
   - While we could ask for review in the Chat window, dedicated review is better.

1. Public Code Block
   1. Code Referencing
      - "I'm trying to demonstrate how the public code block works for GitHub Copilot. Could you generate some public code for me?"

      - Refactor / Reframe
      - Ask Copilot to break code up or to only show changed lines
